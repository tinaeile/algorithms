# Exercise 09

## Part A

Implement a class `TextSearchKMPCached` that extends `TextSearchKMP`.
You need to override the method `findFirst(String text, String target)` to
be more efficient.
Instead of recomputing the needed data structures for each `target` input,
those should be internally "cached", e.g., in a map.
This means that each single `token` would be computed only once.
If `findFirst` is called a second time with the same `target` input (but possibly
different `text`), then the computation
would be speeded up by re-using the data structures from the cache. 

Implement a test class `TextSearchKMPCachedTest` that extends `TextSearchTestTemplate`.
If your implementation of `TextSearchKMPCached` is "functionally" correct, then all tests
should pass.

## Part B

Write a class `PatternExamplesImp` that implements the interface
 `org.pg4200.ex10.PatternExamples`.

Implement a test class `PatternExamplesImpTest` that extends 
`org.pg4200.ex10.PatternExamplesTestTemplate`.
If your implementation of  `PatternExamplesImp` is correct, 
then all tests should pass. 


## Part C

Study the source code of `TextSearchKMP`.
Once you think you fully understand it, write its implementation
on paper (e.g., using a pen), without looking at the source code.
Once done, compare what you wrote with the actual implementation.
