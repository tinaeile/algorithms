/**
 * Think about "streams" like enhanced iterators over a collection.
 * <p>
 * On a stream, we can apply transformation that can alter the data
 * in the stream, and how we retrieve such data.
 * This is achieved by pipelining different stream together.
 * <p>
 * A stream will be closed by a terminal operation, which will
 * specify what to do with the values coming from the stream.
 *
 * Note: here we are only having a few examples of methods available
 * for streams. The collections in the JDK API have many more.
