                following the previousStage reference.
                How they are actually pipelined depend on the kind

           of type OUT pulling such data.
           However, how and if such data should be sent to this consumer
           will depend on the characteristics of the pipe (eg if a filter,
           or a mapper).
           Point is, when the Consumer for OUT pulls data from current pipe,
           the current pipe needs to pull from its upstream (unless it is
           the source directly on the collection).
           So, here we need to create a Consumer representing the current pipe
           which will take data of type IN from the upstream.
           When such data is read, it will do some computation (depending on
           the kind of pipe), create some data of type OUT, and call the input
           consumer for OUT, creating a so called chain.
           How the chaining is done will depend on the kind of Stream,
           and so this method must be overridden.

           Note: this method is not abstract, and rather throw an exception if
           not overridden because the first pipe will have no chain with a previous
           one (and so does not need this method).

                    whereas the current anonymous one we are writing is Y.
                    This new pipe Y will take something as input and call the chained consumer
