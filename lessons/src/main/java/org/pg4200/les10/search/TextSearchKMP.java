        We build a "deterministic finite-state automaton" (DFA),
        which can be represented by a matrix.

        The matrix is in the form [c][j]:
        c -> is a character (there are 2^16 due to UTF-16)
        j -> the position in the target we are evaluating (so there are target.length())
        [c][j] -> what element in the target we should compare next when scanning
                  the next char in the text.

        Note: this could be optimized, as there is a LOT of wasted space for the chars
        not in the target, eg by using a Map instead of a matrix.

            Point is, for j==0 (ie when we are trying to match the first

            on the first position j==0, so we keep the default

                a valid char for a match starting between 1 and j-1.

                Note: in the very first loop (ie, j==1) we have x==0, and so
