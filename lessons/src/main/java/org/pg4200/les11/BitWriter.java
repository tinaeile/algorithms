/**
 * Programs and CPUs work at byte (8 bits) level.
 * Even a boolean in Java takes actually 8 bits (eg, in
 * an array of booleans).
 * <p>
 * However, for compression, we need to work at bit level, to
 * exploit all the available space.
 * For example, we want to use a single bit for representing
 * a boolean, and not 8.
 * <p>
 * So, in this class, we create a data structure that can be
 * considered like a list of bits, where we can add data
 * in chunks of bits, ie at a finer granularity than
 * working with bytes.
 * <p>
 * But there is no silver bullet: the downside here is that
 * reading/parsing such data at bit level is much more expensive
 * <p>
 * Note: to be precise, the situation is even more complex.
 * The type boolean is the only one whose size is not actually
 * defined, as JVM implementation dependent (although usually 1 byte).
 * Furthermore, the JVM bytecode on the stack works with chunks of 32 bits,
 * so types "byte" and "boolean" actually consumes 32 bits on the instruction
 * execution stack. But that is not the case for when storing arrays in the heap,
 * in which the granularity is at byte level.
